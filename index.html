                            <p>I am a woman with a broad range of activities, skills, talents, and interests. The term “Renaissance soul” has always been something that has followed me around all my life. My first ever childhood idols were Xena, the Warrior Princess, and Hercules. They were brave, stood up for the weak and poor, and had phenomenal fighting skills - as well as the “Renaissance” range of various other talents. I believe I took this too seriously in the subsequent years to follow.</p>
                            <p>Fast forward to a little over 2 decades from those early days, and you can find me cooking gourmet meals for my family and friends. When I’m not doing that, I’m studying astrology, Eastern cultures and spiritual, occult & esoteric philosophies. And when I need a more physical kind of relaxation, you can find me in the gym weight-training and powerlifting! But most important of all, I am an artist from the inside out. I draw, paint, create tattoo art, and sing! I love the heavy/death metal scene and live music in general. I am also a proud mother of a 10-year old boy, who actually codes video games in Scratch. All I have to do now, is to officially learn a musical instrument, and find a martial art to learn so I can make my child self proud. And this is all very typical for me!</p>
